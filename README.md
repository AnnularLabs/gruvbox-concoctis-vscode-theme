Noctis is a colection of light & dark themes with a well balanced blend of warm and cold medium contrast colors.

The theme is designed to:

-  be easy on the eyes thus reducing the eye strain
-  give semantic meaning to theme's colors

Noctis comes in five versions. Four are dark and one is light.

The background of the three dark variants is a very saturated very dark cold bluish cyan. The background of the fourth version is a very saturated very dark cold azure. Blue is a cool calming color that shows creativity and intelligence and has a calming effect on the psyche.

The light's theme background is a very saturated very light warm orange. Orange can increase oxygen supply to the brain to produce an invigorating effect.

## **Font** used in the screenshots

The font in the screenshots are actually 2 fonts glued together with [Custom CSS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css). For normal style I used [Hasklig](https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig) and for italics [Cartograph Mono CF](http://connary.com/cartograph.html).
I think there is a beautiful synergy between the two fonts and they intertwine naturally together.

## Syntax colors

The color names were matched to one of the following main color hues: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Brown and Grey using the excelent online tools [Color Name & Hue](http://www.color-blindness.com/color-name-hue/) and [Name that Color](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color).
