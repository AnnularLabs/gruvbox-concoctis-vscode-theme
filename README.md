______

Noctis is a colection of light & dark themes with a well balanced blend of warm and cold medium contrast colors.

The theme is designed to:
-  be easy on the eyes thus reducing the eye strain
-  give semantic meaning to theme's colors

Noctis comes in five versions. Four are dark and one is light.

The background of the three dark variants is a very saturated very dark cold bluish cyan. The background of the fourth version is a very saturated very dark cold azure. Blue is a cool calming color that shows creativity and intelligence and has a calming effect on the psyche.

The light's theme background is a very saturated very light warm orange. Orange can increase oxygen supply to the brain to produce an invigorating effect.
